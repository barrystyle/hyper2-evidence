# hyper2-evidence

April 2017 - an agreement to migrate HYPER from its old chain to a new one, with longer block times, to distance itself from its existing bloated chain was agreed upon by barrystyle/CryptoDatabase.
While the product was delivered (and lots of testing in the meantime, nightly correspondence); it was delivered 4-5 days late. During this time, CryptoDatabase had approached another dev and given him the project instead.

The two files (tgz'd to preserve timestamp) were among many revisions, this being the last one sent, sent to CryptoDatabase. Additionally, a peer was hosted free of charge; provided alongside the codebase. I will leave it up to the other users to pass judgement.
